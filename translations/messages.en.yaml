        This is the first paragraph on the translation page.
        And it's great !
        However, we cannot return the line with this character " > "

    deuxieme_paragraphe : |
        This is the second paragraph on the translation page.
        We can do line breaks with this character " | " , with the nl2br filter.
        And it's great !

            Another possibility of the YAML language which can the prove to be 
            pratical in the case of catalogs !

            Let's take the previous example of the charter to make a list. 
            Indeed, We often come acroos a series of paragraphs, some of which
            will be deleted, others added, and we must be able to do this fairly quickly.
            If you are nit using a list, and you delete part 2 of 3, or add a new paragraph
            between two other ... you must either adapt your view or renumber the parts 
            and paragraphs. In short, it is clearly not ideal.

            Fortunately, there is a way to avoid this in YAML, and here's how.

            the notation 0..2 is a twig syntax for generating a linear sequence. 
            The number before the colon (..) is the beginning, the number after is the end

            So when you insert it in the rigth place in the catalog, without worrying
            about its number. you only have to increment the end of the sequence in lefor.
            Similary if you delete a paragraph, you onlyhave to decrement the limit of the sequence.
